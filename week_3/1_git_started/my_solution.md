## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add

Add works as an intro to git. The files are brought to git's attention because without this command, Git will not know what has changed. 

#### branch

Branch will help you branch out from your master repository. It will create a new branch, where you or your collaborators can work on. Then after the changes the branches would be pushed back to the master repository. You can name the branch by typing git branch "filename".

#### checkout

Git checkout will let you see a repository that you are not in currently. You can use it to check your master branch or a specific branch by typing git checkout master or git checkout "filename".

#### clone

Git clone will take an exsisting repository (it could be anyone's repository) and copy it over to your repository. You can pull/fetch from it and even push if you have the permissions to do so.

#### commit

The commit command will save your file locally on your computer. When you commit, you will essentially be saving a version of your file. You also want to place a comment so you can keep track of your commits. An example would be to do: git commit --m "your comment".

#### fetch

The fetch command will grab all the objects from the online repository and sync them with your local repository. It will update your files on your local repository.

#### log

The Git log command will show you a list of commits made on a branch. Each listing will show who made the commit, and what time and day it was committed.

#### merge

This merge command will merge your branch files to the master branch. You can merge specific branches by typing git merge "filename".

#### pull

The pull command will take any Github files from the online repository and pull them on to your desktop. So if someone is working on the same document and they made changes and you want the updated version, you would pull to your computer.

#### push

Push will push your changed file from your local repository to the online github repository that you have set to save the file in.

#### reset
The Git reset command will unstage any git adds you have done. It is basically the undo button for git add. You can reset a file or all the files you have added.

#### rm

Rm is the command to delete a file from git. The git files that are rm will no longer be tracked.

#### status

This is to see what the current state is of our project. Has it changed, has it been added or commited?


## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository

You would first git add the file, then git commit --m "comments", then git push

- Fetch changes

You can fetch changes by doing git fetch. This will copy over the objects that have changed to your local repository. You would then have to merge to combine the files to the master.

- Commit locally

you would first git add the file, then git commit --m "comments". This would commit on your local repository.

## Release 5: Reflection

I have been a little familiar with Git and GitHub. I have actually been using the git commands to git add, git status, git commit, and git push throughout phase 0 unit 1. Those are the only commands I've been using so those are the only real ones I understand. I did learn about the other commands but am still confused with them. I know what git pull and git fetch does, but I probably need someone to tell me an example of it in terms of using it in real life. I am also a little confused with git branch, git checkout, git merge, and git reset. I kind of understand what they do, but again I need an example of when I would ever use those. I did learn some new features about Git, but I won't get the full experience until I start using them, and that will be when we start collaborating on work. I am pretty confident about the learning comeptencies of this activity, but the learnGitBranching activity was a little confusing. I did enjoy reading the articles and watching the video on Git. I already had installed Git on my computer so I was good to go with that. I did watch a YouTube video that helped me understand Git basics, that I even passed on to other students who found it useful. Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE .
