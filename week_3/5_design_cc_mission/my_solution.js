// I worked by myself on this challenge

// Your mission description:
// 
// 
// 

// Pseudocode
//
// Ravi move up  x2
// Ravi jump over the fence
// Ravi move right
// Ravi attack
// Ravi move right
// 

// Initial Code

var person = "Ravi" {
	name: "Ravi"
	age: "24"
	weapon: "Sword"
	clan: "Swordins"
}


this.moveUp();
this.moveUp();
this.jumpUp();
this.moveRight();
this.attackNearbyEnemy();
this.moveRight





// Refactored Code

// I am not sure yet how to refactor. The only thing I understand when it means to refactor is to make your code more concise. I am still grasping the knowledge about JavaScript, so my code is very simple and easy. Once I learn and practice more, my code will be more extensive where refractoring will be crucial to help not only speed up applications but make it clear and concise.






// Reflection
// I understand the concept of assigning variables. I also understand the element of making properties. I understand that the "this." command is for calling for the action. I did make calls for the character Ravi to make actions, but I am not sure if that was exactly what I was suppose to do. I think I need to define what each move does with Javascript. I am unsure exactly how to do that. I also don't understand much of refractoring besides that you should make your code more concise. My question for that would be, shouldn't you already be making your code concise to begin with? I am not all that confident with the learning competencies because I feel I haven't grasped JavaScript. I did learn how to make the commands to make my character move. I also sort of understand Pseudocode, to me its just notes writing about how to write the commands. If you write what you want to do first, then you can go back and figure out how to do it with code. I did enjoy this activity, being able to make your own CC mission. I felt that maybe I didn't get much out of it because I am still confused about JavaScript.
