# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think the web standards are good because they help clarify the standard size of web pages and content. It would be weird to have websites that have all completely different page px widths. One would be small, one would be big, it would be a complete mess.

The standard structure does make sense to me, but it becomes very broad. I can imagine you have all your code all set, then for any errors, you would have to look through all the divs, narrow it down to heading, then paragraphs, etc. It is time consuming especially if you have a lot of content in your web pages.

I do like the new HTML5 elements because it helps breakdown your webpage into sections that you can easily refer to. Now all the sections don't have to be divs, they can be distinguished as heading, nav, sections, footer. It will help easily narrow down when it comes to de-bugging and having to search for the section.

Reset.css is necessary to help "standardize" your webpage. It makes sure you have consistent fonts, color, spacing. It also cleans up your webpage to make it even better looking.

I have used only Chrome. I used to use Safari before all this phase 0 work. I have noticed sometimes in the past, some things don't work on safari. It is usually like a video, or some sort of downloading problem when working with web applications. Chrome is a very simple, easy, and fast browser without all the extra stuff attached to it that you don't need. I think its a bad thing from a programming standpoint because thats just one more additional thing you have to worry about. You have to make sure your application or web page is compatible with all browsers and make sure it looks good on all of them. If someone can't see your website or application due to compatibility issues with their browser, your viewers will not stay on your page for long or worse yet, not find your page in working condition to be on it in the first place.
