My Website url: ravip0711.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that design has gotten more complicated over the years as viewers are using all sorts of devices from computers to smart phones. Design is the actual process of coordinating where everything on the web page goes and why it goes there. The design part is basically the layout of the web page. User experience is basically how the viewer is feeling when they are on the web page.

I think its okay. I feel like someone who is familiar with computers and the internet knows the typical designs that majority of websites have. I feel there are only so many ways you have put the content of a web page to make it work. For example, you obviously can't put a header at the bottom of the page, it wouldn't make sense. So typically all web pages have their header at the top. Design to me is more about smaller elements that could be put in a simple or unique way. However, you have to consider your audience because you audience might like the simplistic way to click on a button vs if you make it something unique they might have to move around their mouse to select it and may even give up. I feel like design is something more conceptual, so theres no real right way to do it. In my mind, I think design and wireframing are nearly the same. In terms of the user experience, I did like that. That part is interesting to me because it goes in-dept to the science behind how people feel and what they do when they visit your web page. You get into the research and might be surprised with what you find about people's behaviors when visiting your web page.

My process was just drawing it out. I drew out my wireframe in the most simplistic way. I could have made it more intricate, but it would have just been harder on me because I am not highly efficient yet at placing all the elements on the webpage how I want them to be. It is something I need to work on. Wireframing is definitely worthwhile to help get your ideas down visually. I think the process of actually placing all the elements how you want them to be is the hard part for those of us who are new to this.

I want to make my site better by making it flow better. Learning the proper way to lay it out on HTML so it flows perfectly. If I knew that, I would have created more side bars on each side.

It was difficult to put into action what I learned. I am not yet proficient with HTML and CSS so it is a learning process that will continue. I can get everything down to how I want to do it, I just am not sure how to execute the HTML. I can do the basics but going into detail is something I need to work on still. I really find the topic of responsive web pages of interest. It just amazes me how changing up the HTML just by little can effect the whole page to fit on any devices' screen. I thought that was just cool, because our technology is in a shift right now from seeing web pages on the desktop to smart phones and tablets. A lot of work still needs to be done with those elements, because I see big companies who have came out with a mobile version of their website and it is always buggy. It is sometimes complicated to use, and sometimes it doesn't even work. I've experienced many times when you click on a link on your smartphone of a page, it shows some sort of error.
