# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


The Document Object Model is a tool that helps you de-bug and figure out your code in real time. You don't have to switch back and forth from your server to your browser when you make changes. You do them immediately and see the result, and you can instantly make tweaks and changes. It helps you make adjustments to your code and see it visually at the same time. The thing that makes sense to me about it is the fact that it saves you time and helps you in real time. No going back and forth, wasting time, figuring out doing trial and error to make your web page visually appealing. The thing that doesn't make sense to me is sometimes where the elements are refereed to. The good thing is that it helps you very much with your coding. The bad thing is that it doesn't work with data. It's more a tool for visual de-bugging.

In comparison, they seem to follow the similar HTML look expect that the wordpress.com site has a lot more coding in it. There are a lot of script tags for advertising sidebars. I see a lot of javascript. There are tons more classes and ids. There is just more content in the wordpress blog site than my github site. I looked at the following blog: http://godsofadvertising.wordpress.com. I'm not entirely sure what exactly I should be looking at for this question, but those are the differences I see.


Chrome Web Tools are fun and helpful. It makes sense to me, why constantly update your file from your server and then have to refresh your browser at every change you make? This makes you a whole lot faster. It might seem like a little pain right now because we are learning everything still, but like anything else, once you get the hang of it, it will make our lives a whole lot easier.

I had an "aha" moment when I learned about the dev tool Inspect. I was like why is there so much focus on dev tools in the browser. I knew about it before I started DBC, but I just knew you could see the HTML of the webpage. I was like whats the big deal, you can see the HTML on a webpage your working on already! I learned that its more than just the ability to see the HTML of a webpage, you can actually manipulate the page yourself. You can also see the CSS file on it at the same time (I didn't really know enough CSS to understand it when I first discovered dev tools Inspect). I'm also very suprised that there are even more tools you can use such as "Network" to analyze your site's speed performance. I was like wow, this makes sense now and could really be helpful.
