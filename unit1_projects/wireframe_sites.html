			<h3>Blog on Uncrate.com<h3>
				The webpage is trying to solve the problem of placing interesting products in a simple, product focused way. They place the products in the center, the rest of the page is not distracting in any way. The visual challange would be since the page is so simple and the image of the products are the only really colorful thing, the text below might seem unimportant. You would have to figure out a better way to make the text something people want to read.

			<h3>Blog on Google.com</h3>
				The webpage is trying to solve the problem of creating a single focus, the google search bar. This is where all the attention goes. Their single goal is to get more people to use google search and make it a fast search experience for them. The visual challenge is making sure its not too static and boring. People will get sick of the simple, usual look. Google's website has not changed much over the years.

			<h3>Blog on Yahoo.com</h3>
				The webpage is trying to solve the problem of creating a one stop place for all news, headlines, and everything you would want to search for in a directory or newspaper. The visual challenge is fitting everything in the webpage. There are so many links and buttons on the website that it might confuse the viewer. The challenge would be to organize it the best way possible, that seems easy and have good readability.
