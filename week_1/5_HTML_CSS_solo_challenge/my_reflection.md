* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I was trying to figure out the whole idea of this project first. I wanted to know what I was constructing first so I would know what I am to make. The resources I used were the "girl develop it" slides, which were the most helpful. I also used the basic and advanced guide to HTML and CSS. I was going to look online for more sources, but I wasn't sure if that was okay with the solo challenges.

I was having trouble with the difference between class and ID. Also had trouble with how padding, boarders, margins, floats, positiong, width, and height all work together. I kind of understand the elements, not sure how to adjust them all so it all flows on the page. I also need to research and learn more about the psuedo-classes for links. I know what they do, but not sure how they get input into the CSS stylesheet.

I did learn something new. I knew what CSS was and how it works with HTML before I started DBC, but I didn't really know how to do it. I learned the basics of how it works, which is pretty easy. I was suprised how easily the HTML and CSS stylesheets link to each other. I just need to work out some minor confusion with the integration of elements between CSS and HTML.

I am pretty confident about what they are. Just need more help on how to use and input it into the documents to make it flow. For example, how many pixels am I suppose to make the page or bar, do I adjust float or positioning, etc.

I enjoyed how fast I learned how to make the HTML file and start structuring it. CSS was pretty easy to figure out, I knew how to change the basics like background color, color of the text, and text aligning.

I'm actually enjoying all the stuff I type out because I like to believe I type fast so nothing seems tedious when you know what your typing and where to place it. Main point "know what your typing and where to place it", I found it quick and easy to structure the HTML. I just didn't grasp the idea of the layout visually with CSS. I did use <div> and understand it is block form, but I am a little unsure of how it is used in HTML. For example, what is the difference between div and p?
