I always heard about IP addresses but never really knew what they really meant. I learned that IP addresses are the special identity number for your own computer, so that it can fetch internet web pages or post web pages. It is like your computer's address on the internet. I also learned what DNS is. The Domain Name System helps translate human-friendly websites named such as www.devbootcamp.com to a computer-friendly IP address. This helps fetch the Dev Bootcamp website and show it in my browser.

I was extremely happy! This is going to be awesome. This is pretty one of my favorite parts, doing all the backend coding and then seeing it update instantly.

I had an "aha" moment when I understood how all steps it takes to get to a webpage. Each computer has it's own IP address, basically its own address on the internet. When we type a website address in our browser, a request gets pushed to the DNS server. The DNS is a directory that translates the server's request from the human friendly-version, www.devbootcamp.com, to the computer-friendly IP address of the Dev Bootcamp website, 162.159.251.42. The DNS is like a phone directory for webpages. This all happens instantly everytime we type in a website address and click links directing to other pages.

All the articles were well written. I would like some more clarification on how the DNS works and is found. I am going to look into that more.
