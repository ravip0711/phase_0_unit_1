Hi Everyone!

I know this is so overdue, but don’t you worry I’m going to catch up! I’d like to introduce myself.

My name is Ravi Patel, I’m from Tucson, AZ. My favorite websites are uncrate.com, google.com, and yahoo.com. My learning style is Kinesthetic, which means I am a social learner, like to interact and see things for myself. I am definitely very examples oriented, I learn the most when I am given examples and real case scenarios.

Here’s links to my wonderful work!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I felt kind of relieved that people in my group had the same feelings as I did. I felt as though everyone is in the same boat. It makes you feel more comfortable and less stressed out from all the overwhelming information and tasks. I've been fortunate enough to be placed in many high stress situations so this was not nearly out of the norm for me, but I didn't quite expect it this soon. I have learned from my experiences in life on how to handle stress and overcome the need to stay in your comfortzone. I am very open and hopefully this trait will help me succeed with DBC!
