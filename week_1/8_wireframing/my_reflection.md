* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that design is very much more than just visual. A lot of thought process goes into the creation of a design and there are many different types of design thinking and user experience methodologies. User experience is something that may seem very simple, but requires a step by step process to be most effective.

I do like design and user experience. Having a marketing major in college, the whole time I was thinking about the typical analytics when it comes to web page design. Things such as conversion, click rate, and average visitor time on page. It was fun working on my site, however I thought design was more conceptual in this activity. Typically, you get more out of design when working in a group and going through the step by step process of creating a design and user experience.

I asked about why wire framing was a huge deal when starting off with a website. I read the resources that were given to us. I felt as though every article had more or less elements than the other in terms of looking for resources. Each one had its little spin on the process of wire framing and designing.

I didn't have trouble with anything in terms of wire framing. I did have trouble with where to post the blog and linking the index.html file.

I did learn about wire framing and how important it is. I learned about the steps involved in designing, which is quite lengthy. I was surprised to see so many steps in coming up with a design and then thought, do companies really spend all that time designing?

I am confident of each of the learning competencies for this challenge. I just wasn't sure where to post my files and what links I needed to include.

I did enjoy making my own blog and designing it. It was a fun activity, knowing what ever code changes I make, I instantly could see how it affected the document. While writing is not my favorite part, I enjoyed styling it with CSS.

I found writing the blog was tedious. It was just very broad about what I thought about each of my favorite websites in terms of wireframing. I felt like I could have written pages and pages of what I thought of it just because I had to do the assignment. Otherwise, I've learned throughout my college experience going through entrepreneurship, its more productive to get to the point in the least amount of sentences as possible. You begin to lose attention and focus when you write too much and too long.
