## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I already have worked with git and GitHub in the past so I was a little familiar with it. It was actually already on my computer and I already had a GitHub account. I didn't have the Mac app for GitHub, so I learned something new that makes it easier to add/delete/edit repositories. I did learn from a video that people view the GitHub Mac app to be the lazy way, and instead its better to just get used to using GitHub from the terminal.

Git is basically a version control software that allows you to track changes made to your code. You can keep track and revert back to changes you have made incase you mess up and make any mistakes. It also helps you create copies of your code, called braches, so you can make edits on them, and merge it back into the main code. GitHub is the software used



Version control helps coders working in a team efficiently make changes to lines of code they are working on. It not only helps all the team members make their own changes and sync it to a master file, but it also keeps track of all changes made to the files. It helps push or pull changes made on lines of codes and files, and help sync it on every team member's personal computer. GitHub is the online software platform that serves as a cloud for all the team members to push and pull from. One person in the group can edit a file using Git, then push it up to the cloud, on GitHub. A second person on the team can pull from the cloud, sync it back to their computer. Git
