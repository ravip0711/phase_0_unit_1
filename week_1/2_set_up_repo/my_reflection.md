You can create a new repository on Github by going on GitHub.com and signing in. Once you are logged in, at the top right corner is your login name, next to it is a plus (+) sign, click on that and select "new repository". On this new screen, type in the repository name.

Next you should see your repository named: "'login name'.github.io", and on the right side of that repository you will see a button called "Clone to Computer".
