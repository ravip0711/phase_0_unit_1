## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

You can create a new repository on Github by going on GitHub.com and signing in. Once you are logged in, at the top right corner is your login name, next to it is a plus (+) sign, click on that and select "new repository". On this new screen, type in the repository name. The repository name should be your "login name".github.io, so for example mine would be: "ravip0711.github.io". Next, make sure the button is clicked for "public" on the center of the window, and also select the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README". This will create a readme file in your repository. Next, in the lower box that says "add a license", click that and change it to "MIT License". Finally, click the button on the bottom that says "Create repository" and magically you have a new repository! Next, since the repository is on Github only (basically on the internet), we need to add the folder with files on our personal computer. You can do this by opening up the GitHub app on your personal computer. When open, on the left side will be your login name, click that. Next you should see your repository named: "'login name'.github.io", and on the right side of that repository you will see a button called "Clone to Computer". Click that button and it will prompt you with a window of where you would like your new repository to be saved on your computer. Once you have selected that, it will add files to your computer, connecting your new Github repository to your computer.

Open Source means sharing your code or program to the the public. If it is Open Source, people will be able to copy your work, edit, or customize it for their needs. Open Source is a great way to get people to try out your software (and use it) and get more ideas on how to improve your code.


I think Open Source is awesome. Not only do we get to use the programs, it also doesn't cost anything to the user. Open Source creates an enviornment for collaboration, people can take your programs and improve them in ways you had not thought about. It opens the door for many creative uses for your program, which can benefit you and others who use it. I would not recommend Open Source if your sole purpose is to make money with your program, and if you have a product/program of value that you believe people are willing to pay money for. However, Open Source will help you achieve much more with your programming because you have a community of programmers that will help you build up your programming. Let's say you made this awesome music editing software and want a lot of people to adopt it to make it the norm for music editing, Open Sourcing the software would make users more likely to adopt because it is free, able to change, and have the ability to use in any way.


Licensing is important because it ensures you get credit for the work that you have done and prevents others from claiming your work as their own. You can also control your code or program in terms of getting credit, and to what extent other's can use it.

I solidified my skills in making a repository and adding the files on my own personal computer. I already knew a little about Open Source, but it was helful to get more clarification as to why web developers use Open Source. I had an "aha" moment when I read about this activity and the section came up about licensing. I instantly knew the rest of the activity was going to be about creating Open Source code, but using a license so you maining the credit for developing it. The only struggle I had was comparing the different types of licensing. It was a little complicated comparing all of them and what factors distinguish them from each other.

I found an article that helped me understand licensing. Here it is: http://opensource.sys-con.com/node/318776.
