## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I understand the basics of HTML. What I don't understand is the differences between using <div> and <p>. I also don't have a clear understanding of the difference between class and ID, and what determines when you use which.

Good thing about HTML is that it lays out the basics of your webpage. All the content is there. The bad is that HTML is not visual until you add CSS. Their are many programs out there that combine the two to make it easier, but I don't have much experience with using them.

I did have an "aha" moment when I found out what <title> was used for. I have made basic html websites in the past for school projects, but never understood how to change the title that shows up at the top of the browser. I solified my understand of the relationship between HTML and CSS, but I have an urge to be efficient at linking the two together.

I found one resource that helped me understand CSS better, but the teacher was quite fast through the video. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE.
